# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Natural Language Processing

## 📌 Project Title
**Exposing the Truth: Fake News Detection Powered by NLP**

---

## 📖 Description

This project aims to build an intelligent system that automatically detects whether a news article is **real** or **fake** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. With the rise of digital misinformation, such a system helps combat the spread of fake news by analyzing article content and predicting its authenticity.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Preprocess and clean textual news data.
- Extract features using TF-IDF vectorization.
- Train a classification model to detect fake news.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Provide a simple interface for users to test article authenticity.
